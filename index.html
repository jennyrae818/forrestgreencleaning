            <h2>&#9900;  About Me  &#9900;</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Jenny Sacco. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Best described as an organized, curious minded, creative, helper. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in West Tacoma, WA with my wonderful FireFighter/Paramedic husband and two fluffy mini Austrailian Shepards.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've worn a variety of hats throughout my lifetime: 9 years of Private Banking at Merrill Lynch, "little ripper" snowboarding instructor at Mount Bachelor, Assistant Teacher at a wonderful Montessori school in Bellevue, WA, and operations at the only hostel in Bend, OR. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017, I walked 900km across the country of Spain over the span of 45 days. Link of "The Way": <a href= 'https://santiago-compostela.net/' target="_blank">The Camino De Santiago</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2019, I've proudly served my community as a Fire Dispatcher for <a href='https://southsound911.org/' target="_blank">Pierce County.</a>
            </p>
            <p>    
                As of May 2022, I completed a web development/coding bootcamp through the University of Washington. I designed and built this website that you are reading through right now.  
            </p>
            <p>    
                My cleaning adventures offically began in Dec 2021. I now own and operate this small house cleaning business named Forrest Green Cleaning, LLC and I'm having so much fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No job is too big or too small. The challenge of finding new ways to be more efficient excites me. I've always wanted to work with my hands and feel so lucky to be able to connect my passion and my work!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not cleaning your house, RV, closet or buzzing around town, you can find me out walking our dogs, reading a good book, or driving my husband crazy by reorganizing another cabinet. 
            </p>

                        <li>I take away any garbage I make - i.e. papertowels, dusters, etc...</li>
                        <li><b>The exciting stuff: </b>vacuuming, dusting, mopping, shining up the outsides of your appliances </li>

                        <li>We'll get you on the books!</li>
                        <li>First time cleans always take the longest. I am getting down the flow of your home, office, or RV and cleaning it to my baseline</li>
                        <li>You decide how often you want me to visit</li>
                        <li>Depending on my frequency, I will still cover all of the basics but will then also start a rotational on certain items like your kitchen cabinets, ceiling fans, bathroom fans, etc. </li>
                        <li>It's as simple and as easy as that</li>

                    <p>From start to finish, Jenny does it right! We could not ask for anything more! From the start, Jenny was prompt and professional for our home walkthrough, she listened very well as I explained what we needed. A quote was provided swiftly via email, with some information about her company. I have a crazy work schedule and she was able to fit me in! She showed up on time, and got to work promptly ensuring our home was cleaned properly right down to the outside of the garbage cans!!! She worked hard to ensure everything was top notch. The work was professional, and the extra details and effort put into the work really touched us. I enjoyed the experience. After each cleaning Jenny personally follows up to ask how everything went. Thanks to her that is one less stress for us! Rating Jenny 5 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for sure!! </p>
